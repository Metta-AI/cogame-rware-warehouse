## The JS wire-constants block: the handful of engine constants the browser
## chrome must agree with (playback speeds, the playback tick rate, the rune
## caps the text layout reserves room for). Rendered ONCE, from the same Nim
## consts the engine runs on; server.nim splices the block into every served
## client page and tools/gen_wire_constants.nim emits it for the static wasm
## bundle. Clients read `window.RWARE_WIRE`.

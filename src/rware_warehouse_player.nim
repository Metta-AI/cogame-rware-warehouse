## The rware-warehouse player container: a policy is just a prompt.
##
## This process is DELIBERATELY thin. It connects to its seat, sends ONE
## Sprite v1 chat message carrying its registration, and then only receives.
## Every decision happens inside the GAME server, because that is the only
## container the platform injects the `anthropic_api_key` coworld secret into,
## and because keeping the control layer server-side is what makes the recorded
## order log reproducible with no network in the loop.
##
##   PLAYER_PROMPT        a strategy in plain English -> this seat is an LLM seat
##   PLAYER_SCRIPTED      shuttle | courteous                -> this seat is scripted
##   PLAYER_POLICY_LABEL  a free label for the replay's `register` record
##
## A seat that sets neither is `courteous`. To field your own policy, reuse this
## image and set PLAYER_PROMPT:
##
##   coworld upload-policy <rware-warehouse-image> --name my-rware \
##     --run /bin/rware-warehouse-player --secret-env PLAYER_PROMPT="<strategy>"
